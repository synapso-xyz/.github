**Smart search and local conversations with your files.**  
Fully private. Fully yours.

## üß† What is Synapso?

Synapso is a local-first knowledge system that helps you **index, search, and query your files** using semantic embeddings and smart chunking. It's built for people who don‚Äôt have time to curate everything but still want to find anything ‚Äî instantly.

Whether you're a developer, researcher, writer, or note-hoarder, Synapso helps you get answers from your files without giving up privacy or control.

## üîê Privacy by Default

- Everything stays on your machine.
- No telemetry. No cloud sync.
- Ideal for sensitive data ‚Äî therapist notes, research, IP, or just your shower thoughts.
